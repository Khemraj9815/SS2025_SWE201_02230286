Practical Report

1. What I Have Done

I have completed the login system using email and password, and also using a magic link. I have written the code for phone SMS login, but it is not working properly yet. I haven’t finished the social auth login.

2. What I Have Learnt

I learned that searching and reading the official documentation is very helpful. I also realized that building a mobile application is quite similar to web development. I found that creating UI in mobile development feels easier compared to web development.

3. What Challenges I Have Faced

I had difficulty setting up the navigation between pages using stack navigation. The phone SMS login didn’t work for me. Getting the client ID for Google login was confusing, and I wasn’t sure if I was doing it right. Also, I struggled a lot while working with Supabase.

4. How I Overcame Them

To solve some problems, I referred to the Supabase documentation to understand and write simple authentication codes. I also asked a friend for help with connecting Supabase. However, many of the problems are still not solved.
